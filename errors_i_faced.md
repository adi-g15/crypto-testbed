* Wrote "using std::chrono" instead of "using namespace std::chrono".
* Using .start() and char& in for_each on a constant string
* Tried using curlpp, but it doesn't work well with CMake, does provide a CMakeLists.txt but that doesn't provide includes, so requires to be installed and not available in repos of distros
